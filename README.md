# CS340-Grazioso-Salvare-Project
* How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To ensure the development of programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, it is crucial to maintain consistency in coding style, including indentation, spacing, and overall formatting. Methods and classes should be well-contained, focused, and designed for easy comprehension. Additionally, incorporating concise comments is essential for explaining the purpose of the source code.
The benefits of writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code extend to facilitating easier maintenance, debugging, updates, and modifications over time. This Python module can be employed for various management applications supported by a database.

  
* How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, the initial step in tackling a problem involves testing the program to pinpoint and identify errors that require correction. Subsequently, a comprehensive understanding of the issue is gained, and the test case document is revisited to check for any similar issues encountered previously. If none are found, a new test case is initiated.
Following this, a plan and methodology are devised to resolve the problem effectively. Finally, the implementation of the plan and methodology takes place. If the problem persists, the process is reiterated until a satisfactory resolution is achieved.

I approached this project/assignment in a manner consistent with my previous projects. I initiated the project early, thoroughly reviewed all relevant documents, anticipated potential constraints, and systematically broke down the task into manageable chunks. I assigned weights to each component and established priorities. To ensure alignment with Grazioso Salvareâ€™s requirements, I highlighted the pertinent requests in the requirement document, effectively using them as a checklist throughout the project.

I prefer employing the Agile methodology as one of my key approaches in the program development process. Agile ensures punctual project execution, active customer involvement, consistent testing and debugging, and, most importantly, it exhibits adaptability to change as the product is delivered incrementally.

* What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

The Canine Recruitment project aims to assist our client, Grazioso Salvare, in identifying dogs suitable for Search and Rescue Training. This application provides users with access to the database, enabling them to create, read, update, and delete existing data from various animal shelters. These functions empower users to efficiently manage persistent data, including tasks such as adding and modifying records, searching for specific criteria within the collection, and removing unnecessary database entries
